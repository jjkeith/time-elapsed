## About

I'm sorry for this, but if you ever wanted to calculate what percentage of your life you have spent in lockdown, now you can. I wanted a project that could be finished in a day or two so I didn't even check if someone else has already done this (and I assume someone has).

As the app notes, the definition of lockdown being used here is *really* loose because it was outside of my scope to account for individuals who have been in and out of lockdown or in "lockdown" but still required to go to a physical workplace. It's just shorthand for what percentage of your life has been impacted by COVID-19.

## Tech

I used vue-cli and bootstrap-vue for expediency.

## TODO
cd
- In a future in which there is an end to lockdown, the calculations will need to be updated with a user-set end date. 
- I'd love to create more visual interest, particularly a pie graph on the final step. 
- Using Bootstrap was a lazy way to get this done in one day. I'd rather replace more custom styles.
- Get vaccinated.
- Be in a better mood.
